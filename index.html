            <h1>Rowan Byers</h1>
            <p> Gosh I don't really know what to say because I don't really have a lot of self esteem. I don't do good work, pay attention or process new information or ideas well. I often think of suicide. I was so miserable at my last job that I decided to just walk off, so don't assign me anything that might break my little snowflake spirit. I need to be coddeled and constantly supervised but I'll also be resentful of anyone who has more power or talent then me. I'm not attractive enough to be a model (plus my face is red a lot of the time) but I am attractive enough to have an overblown sense of self worth that when not reflected back to me in clear praise, withers like a leaf in fall.</p>
            <br>
            <p> TLDR; I don't like myself, I don't like you, don't hire me.</p>
